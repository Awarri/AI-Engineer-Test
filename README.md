# Test Introduction

At Awarri, we are at the forefront of developing AI solutions that are transforming how machine learning teams operate globally. Our commitment to democratizing frontier technology in Africa is embodied in our cutting-edge tools and systems. As part of our ongoing mission, we are enhancing our cloud-based annotation system, which plays a pivotal role in AI model development across various sectors, including life sciences, robotics, and manufacturing.

This 6-hour test split into two 3-hour parts will cover two different aspects of AI/Ml development: Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. 

# Task One Overview

Your task is to create a new AI-powered either an Interactor, Dectector or Tracker for integration with CVAT, designed to significantly speed up and improve the precision of the annotation workflow for a user labeling a dataset.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What exactly are Interactors, Detectors, and Trackers in the context of CVAT?

- **Answer**: In CVAT, an Interactor is an AI tool used for interactive segmentation of objects in images or videos. A Detector automatically identifies and labels objects in a dataset, while a Tracker follows the movement of objects across frames in a video. Each tool plays a unique role in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the annotation process.

### 2. Can I use external libraries or frameworks for developing these AI tools?

- **Answer**: Yes, you are encouraged to use any external libraries or frameworks that you find suitable for developing the AI tools, provided they are compatible with the CVAT environment.

### 3. What programming languages can I use for this task?

- **Answer**: While Python is the primary language used in CVAT, you may use any programming language you are comfortable with. However, ensure that your final submission can be integrated with CVAT, which is Python-based.

### 4. How should the prototype be presented?

- **Answer**: The prototype can be presented as a script, a pseudo-code, or even a flowchart that demonstrates the core functionality of your AI tool. It should be detailed enough to convey your approach and the expected functionality.

### 5. What if I need more information about CVAT and its existing AI tools?

- **Answer**: For more detailed information about CVAT and its existing AI tools, you can visit the [CVAT GitHub Repository](https://github.com/opencv/cvat) and the [CVAT AI Tools Documentation](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/advanced/ai-tools/).

### 6. Are there specific requirements for the dataset to be used in testing the tool?

- **Answer**: No specific dataset is required. You may use any publicly available dataset that best demonstrates the capabilities of your AI tool. However, ensure that the dataset is relevant to the functionality of the tool you are developing.

### 7. What should I focus on in the evaluation and integration outline?

- **Answer**: Your evaluation and integration outline should focus on how your tool will improve the labeling process in CVAT, including its accuracy, speed, and user interaction. Also, outline how your tool can be integrated into the existing CVAT system.
